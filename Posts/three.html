    <h1>Why I think the new Wednesday Netflix show is overrated</h1>
    <h1>=============================================</h1>
    <h3>So as you all know netflix released Wednesday on November 23rd of 2022 and it instantly broke records in no time which is impressive.<br>
        My opinion on this show is that it's just a spin on the addams family to turn it into a cheap teen drama for some quick cash<br>
        I am not good at writing articles or getting my opinion across so all ima say to make this short and sweet is:<br>
        - They ruined morticia and gomez<br>
        - The plot armor on Wednesday was painful<br>
        - piranhas in chlorine<br>
        - Overall it felt like a netflix-ified teenage drama made for kids<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        but hey who knows? maybe im just salty that the cringe fanbase ruined the song Bloody Mary with Wednesday's atrocious dance.<br>
