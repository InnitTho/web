    <h1>Why I hate MacOS</h1>
    <h1>=============================================</h1>
    <h3>I am not really good at writing long articles but here's why i have a burning hate for the inbred child of openBSD known as MacOS<br>
        - Macbooks feel like an Ipad with cocomelon when you're trying to do anything other than watch youtube and send emails  <br>
        - Hardware that isn't worth the price (the battery is good tho) <br>
        - It's really locked down to the point where you can barely do anything basic like run 32 bit apps <br>
        - What the hell is a command key? Option key? and of course the fn key is for changing language lol WHY CANT YOU JUST BE NORMAL ISTG THERE'S NO NEED TO BE SPECIAL AND INCONVIENT ANT THE SAME TIME.  <br>
        <br>
        To conclude, apple is bad <br>
        <br>
        cya :D
